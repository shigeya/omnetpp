      it with new editors, views, wizards, and additional functionality. OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ adds functionality for creating and
      configuring models (NED and ini files), performing batch executions, and analyzing simulation
      results, while Eclipse provides C++ editing, SVN/GIT integration, and other optional features (UML
      modeling, bugtracker integration, database access, etc.) via various open-source and commercial plug-ins.

      Submodules can be created using the palette of available module types. Visual and non-visual properties
      can be modified in the Properties View, or by dialogs invoked from the context menu. The editor offers
      many features such as unlimited undo/redo, object cloning, constrained move and resize, alignment of objects, and zooming.</p><p>Submodules can be pinned (having a fixed position), or unpinned (auto-layout). Graphical
      features that can be edited are background image, background grid, default icons (via display string
      inheritance), icon sizing and coloring, transmission range, and many others.</p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/img3.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Properties view</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="pictures/img3.png" align="middle" alt="Properties view"></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The Properties View lets the user edit graphical and non-graphical properties of objects. Special
      cell editors facilitate selecting colors, icons, etc. Undo and redo is supported for property changes

When hitting Ctrl+Space, the editor
      offers context-aware completion of keywords and module type, parameter, gate, and submodule names.
      Template proposals to insert full compound module skeletons, submodules, various connection structures,
      etc. are also available. Documentation of referenced module types can be viewed by hovering over the NED
      type name. The NED source is continually parsed and validated as the user is typing, and errors are
      displayed in real time on the left margin. Syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, and automatic
      conversion from the OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ 3.x NED syntax are also provided.</p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/img5.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Outline View</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="pictures/img5.png" align="middle" alt="Outline View"></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The Outline View shows the structure of NED files in both graphical and text editing mode, and

      The Module Hierarchy View and the NED Parameters View can also be used with the NED Editor (they will
      display the submodule hierarchy and the parameters of the selected module or submodule) &#8211; these views
      will be described with the Ini File Editor. Further related views are the Problems View (which displays

      forms, organized by topics. Descriptions and default values are displayed in tooltips, which can be made
      persistent for easier reading. The structure of the ini file (sections and their inheritance tree) is also
      visualized and editable via drag&amp;drop and dialogs. Validation and content assist
        (Ctrl+Space) are also provided where needed. The editor supports unlimited undo/redo and
         automatic conversion from OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ 3.x ini files.</p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/img7.png"></a><p class="title"><b>The ini file source editor</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="pictures/img7.png" align="middle" alt="The ini file source editor"></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The text editor lets the user work with the ini file directly, which is more efficient for
      advanced users than forms. Unlimited undo/redo, syntax coloring, and completion of configuration keys, values,
      and module parameter patterns (on Ctrl+Space) are provided. As the user types, the file is continually
      analyzed and errors/warnings are displayed in real time.</p><p>
      The editor considers all NED declarations (simple modules, compound modules, channels, etc.) and can
      fully exploit this information to provide diagnostics and assistance to the user. Looking at the 
      <span class="emphasis"><em>network=</em></span>
      configuration key, it knows the top-level compound module NED type, and internally builds a static picture
      of the network by recursively enumerating the top-level module's submodules, sub-submodules,
      sub-sub-submodules, etc., and continually relates this information to the ini file contents. Thus, the
      editor always knows which ini file keys match which module parameters, which are the ini file keys that
      are unused (will not match anything), and which module parameters are still open (i.e. have no value assigned
      yet). It displays this information in tooltips, as warnings, and in various views.

      To speed up the process of creating ini files from scratch, the editor offers an
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Add Missing Keys</em></span>
      dialog. After clicking OK, the editor will insert ini file keys for all open NED parameters. The user
      will only need to supply the values.

      The Module Hierarchy View displays the submodule hierarchy of the current configuration's network,
      together with the module's parameters. It shows how module parameters obtain their values (from NED, by
      applying a NED default value, or from the ini file). It is able to resolve simple cases where a submodule
      type comes from a string parameter (NED's
      <span class="emphasis"><em>like</em></span>
      keyword). By using the context menu, the user can go to the NED declaration of a module, submodule,
      parameter, gate, or to the place where a parameter gets its value (in NED or in the ini file).
    </p><p>The View can be pinned to a particular editor to prevent its contents from changing when the user

      current configuration's network and it can be switched over to show all parameters, assigned or
      unassigned. For assigned parameters, it shows how they obtain their values (from NED, by applying a NED
      default value, or from the ini file). The user can open the relevant places in the NED files or the
      ini file. This View can also be pinned.</p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/img11.png"></a><p class="title"><b>The Problems View</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="pictures/img11.png" align="middle" alt="The Problems View"></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The Problems View presents errors, warnings, and info messages in NED files, ini files, and other

      projects, by severity, etc).</p><p>

      is possible to run a simulation as a normal C/C++ application and perform C++ source-level debugging on
      it. The user can also run it as a standalone application (under Tkenv or Cmdenv) or  run batches of simulations
      where runs differ in module parameter settings or random number seeds (NOTE: an Eclipse-based runtime
      environment [&#8220;IDEEnv&#8221;] does not exist yet; it is planned for future releases).</p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/img12.png"></a><p class="title"><b>The Run dialog showing a simulation launch

      In the Eclipse IDE, the various ways of launching a program under development is described by launch
      configurations. There are various launch configuration types (C/C++ Application, Java Application, etc.).
      To launch a program for the first time, the user creates an instance of a launch configuration, fills in
      a form (program name, command-line arguments, etc.), and hits the Run button. OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ provides launch
      configuration types for simulations: one extends the normal &#8220;C/C++ Local Application&#8221; launch type with a
      <span class="emphasis"><em>Simulation</em></span>
      tab (for convenient editing of simulation-related command-line options), and a standalone launch type
      for launching a simulation or running simulation batches. The former can be used for C++ debugging, as
      well.
    </p><p>The dialog shows a standalone launch type for the QueueNet example simulation model. Batch
      simulations can be launched by specifying more than one run number in the dialog. Ini files 
       allow the user to define various scenarios iterating over a list of values for certain
      NED parameters, and/or do multiple runs with different seeds. The launch dialog helps the user select
      the desired run numbers by showing which runs correspond to which parameters and seed settings.</p><p>Multi-processor or multi-core computers can be exploited by specifying that more than
      one process may be launched (i.e. may be running) at a time.</p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/img13.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Progress View</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="pictures/img13.png" align="middle" alt="Progress View"></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The Progress View reports the status of simulation execution when you have a long-running
      simulation, or you are executing several runs in a batch. It is possible to cancel the whole batch
      operation with a single click, if necessary. Simulations run in separate processes
      that do not block the IDE, so users can keep working while their simulations run in the
      background. In the above screenshot, the number of processes to run in parallel was set to 2; run #1 has
      already terminated (and is no longer shown), run #3 has already launched, and run #2 is still
      running.</p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/img14.png"></a><p class="title"><b>Console View</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="pictures/img14.png" align="middle" alt="Console View"></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>Each running process sends its output to a separate console buffer within the Console View, so
      the user can review the output after a simulation has finished. One can switch between console

      scheduling and canceling self-messages, sending messages, display changes, module and connection
      creation and deletion, user log messages, etc. The result is an event log file which contains detailed
      information of the simulation, and later can be used for various purposes, such as visualizing message
      exchanges among modules on a sequence chart. The file format is line-based text to facilitate processing
      by third party tools.</p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/img16.png"></a><p class="title"><b>A Sequence Chart showing ARP on a wireless network

On the Sequence Chart, events
      are represented as nodes, and message send/schedule/reuse operations as arrows. The chart can be
      filtered according to modules, message types, and various other criteria. The chart can also be filtered according to the
      causes/consequences of a particular event (this works by following message arrows backward and forward
      in simulation time). The chart timeline can be displayed in various modes, such as linear (simulation
      time), compact (non-linear), and event number-based. Other features include sorting of module axes, displaying state vector
      data on axes (using output vector files), zooming, and special navigation options (bookmarks, zoom to
      message send, follow message send), and exporting the chart in SVG format.</p><p>Both the Event Log Table and the Sequence Chart are capable of efficiently displaying event log
      files of several gigabytes without requiring large amounts of memory.</p><div class="figure"><a name="pictures/img17.png"></a><p class="title"><b>The Event Log View</b></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="screenshot"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><img src="pictures/img17.png" align="middle" alt="The Event Log View"></div></div></div></div><br class="figure-break"><p>The Event Log Table displays the content of an event log file recorded during a simulation. It
      supports raw and descriptive notations, line-based filtering for event log entry types and various
      parameters, search for free text, bookmarks, and special navigation options such as "go to simulation time"
      or message arrival. The Event Log Table supports the same filtering as the Sequence Chart.</p></div><div class="sect1" lang="en"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="id302974"></a>Scave (Result Analysis)</h2></div></div></div><p>Scave is the result analysis tool of OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ and its task is to help the user process and
      visualize simulation results saved into vector and scalar files. Scave is designed so that the user can
      work equally well on the output of a single simulation run (one or two files) and the result of
      simulation batches (which may be several hundred files, possibly in multiple directories). Ad-hoc
      browsing of the data is supported in addition to systematic and repeatable processing. With the latter, 
      all processing and charts are stored as &#8220;recipes&#8221;. For example, if simulations need to be re-run
      due to a model bug or misconfiguration, existing charts do not need to be drawn all over again. Simply
      replacing the old result files with the new ones will result in the charts being automatically displayed
      with the new data.</p><p>Scave is implemented as a multi-page editor. What the editor edits is the &#8220;recipe,&#8221; which includes what
      files to take as inputs, what data to select from them, what (optional) processing to apply, and what
      kind of charts to create from them. The pages (tabs) of the editor roughly correspond to these steps.
      You will see that Scave is much more than just a union of the OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ 3.x Scalars and Plove tools.

    </p><p>The underlying assumption is that users will organize their simulation-based research into
      various &#8220;experiments&#8221;. An experiment will consist of several &#8220;measurements&#8221;, which are typically (but
      not necessarily) simulations done with the same model but with different parameter settings; that is,
      the user will explore the parameter space with several simulation runs. To gain statistical
      confidence in the results, each measurement will be possibly repeated several times with different
      random number seeds. It is easy to set up such scenarios with the improved ini files of OMNeT&#8288;+&#8288;+ 4.x. 
     Then, the experiment-measurement-replication labels will be assigned more-or-less automatically &#8211; please
