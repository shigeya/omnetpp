<h2><a name="sec101"/>1.1 What Is OMNeT++?</h2>

<p>OMNeT++ is an object-oriented modular discrete event network simulation
framework. It has a generic architecture, so it can be (and has been)
used in various problem domains:

<p><ul>
  <li>modeling of wired and wireless communication networks
  <li>protocol modeling
  <li>modeling of queueing networks
  <li>modeling of multiprocessors and other distributed hardware systems
  <li>validating of hardware architectures
  <li>evaluating performance aspects of complex software systems
  <li>in general, modeling and simulation of
        any system where the discrete event approach is suitable, and
        can be conveniently mapped into entities communicating by exchanging
        messages.
</ul>

<p>OMNeT++ itself is not a simulator of anything concrete, but rather
provides infrastructure and tools for <i>writing</i> simulations. One of
the fundamental ingredients of this infrastructure is a component
architecture for simulation models. Models are assembled from reusable
components termed <i>modules</i>. Well-written modules are truly reusable,
and can be combined in various ways like LEGO blocks.

<p>Modules can be connected with each other via gates (other systems would
call them ports), and combined to form compound modules. The depth of
module nesting is not limited. Modules communicate through message passing,
where messages may carry arbitrary data structures. Modules can pass
messages along predefined paths via gates and connections, or directly to
their destination; the latter is useful for wireless simulations, for
example. Modules may have parameters that can be used to customize module
behavior and/or to parameterize the model's topology.
Modules at the lowest level of the module hierarchy are called
simple modules, and they encapsulate model behavior. Simple modules
are programmed in C++, and make use of the simulation library.

<p>OMNeT++ simulations can be run under various user interfaces.
Graphical, animating user interfaces are highly useful for
demonstration and debugging purposes, and command-line user
interfaces are best for batch execution.

<p>The simulator as well as user interfaces and tools are highly portable.
They are tested on the most common operating systems (Linux, Mac OS/X,
Windows), and they can be compiled out of the box or after trivial
modifications on most Unix-like operating systems.

<p>OMNeT++ also supports parallel distributed simulation. OMNeT++ can
use several mechanisms for communication between partitions of
a parallel distributed simulation, for example MPI or named pipes.
The parallel simulation algorithm can easily be extended, or new
ones can be plugged in. Models do not need any special instrumentation
to be run in parallel -- it is just a matter of configuration.
OMNeT++ can even be used for classroom presentation of parallel
simulation algorithms, because simulations can be run in parallel
even under the GUI that provides detailed feedback on what is going on.

<p>OMNEST is the commercially supported version of OMNeT++.
OMNeT++ is free only for academic and non-profit use;
for commercial purposes, one needs to obtain OMNEST licenses
from Simulcraft Inc.

<h2><a name="sec102"/>1.2 Organization of This Manual</h2>

<p>The manual is organized as follows:

<p><ul>
  <li>The Chapters <a href="chap1.html#sec100">[1]</a> and <a href="chap2.html#sec103">[2]</a>
    contain introductory material
  <li>The second group of chapters,
    <a href="chap3.html#sec115">[3]</a>,
    <a href="chap4.html#sec138">[4]</a> and
    <a href="chap7.html#sec256">[7]</a>
    are the programming guide. They present the NED language<!--ned!language-->,
    describe the simulation concepts and their implementation in OMNeT++, explain
    how to write simple<!--module!simple--> modules, and describe the class library.
  <li>The chapters <a href="chap11.html#sec378">[11]</a> and <a href="chap14.html#sec437">[14]</a>
    explain how to customize
    the network graphics and how to write NED source code comments
    from which documentation can be generated.
  <li>Chapters <a href="chap8.html#sec310">[8]</a>,
    <a href="chap9.html#sec327">[9]</a>, <a href="chap10.html#sec353">[10]</a> and
    <a href="chap12.html#sec399">[12]</a> deal with practical issues
    like building and running simulations and analyzing results, and
    describe the tools OMNeT++ provides to support these tasks.
  <li>Chapter <a href="chap15.html#sec455">[15]</a> is devoted to the support
    of distributed execution.
  <li>Chapters <a href="chap16.html#sec464">[16]</a> and <a href="chap17.html#sec477">[17]</a>
    explain the architecture and internals of OMNeT++, as well as
    ways to extend it and embed it into larger applications.
  <li>The appendices provide a reference on the NED language,
    configuration options, file formats, and other details.
</ul>
